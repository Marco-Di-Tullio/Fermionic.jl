    "## Why Julia?\n",
    "I first wrote this code in Mathematica, and was intrigued by performance and usage comparison with Python. There were many advantages of writing the program in Python, like defining classes and methods, which was something very awkward  to emulate in Mathematica. The drawback was, nonetheless, that Python was 10 times slower than Mathematica. This is no surprise, as Mathematica compiles directly in the C language, whereas Python needs to go through numpy in order to access C functionalities (Cython was not an option, as I wanted the source code to be crystal clear to the user). \n",
    "Then I heard about Julia. I started learning the language and found it to be extremely  clear to the user, even more than Python. I run the same code and it was 10 times faster than Mathematica, and 100 times faster than Python. Besides, Julia uses something called \"multiple dispatch\", which replaces the traditional object oriented programming (single dispatch) and is really handy for using the same method with different types of objects. So I decided to try out this language and was more than satisfied with the results.\n",

    "## Installing Julia and Juno\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets first cover the setup needed for executing the package.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First of all, you must download and install the latest Julia version. You can find it in [this link](https://julialang.org/downloads/). \n",
    "2. Once installed, it is necessary to install some interpreter. I strongly recommend using [Juno](https://junolab.org/), which is a package for Atom. You must first download and install [Atom](https://atom.io/). Then from settings, you just type **uber-juno** and wait as many packages are installed. Alternatively, you can download [JuliaPro](https://juliacomputing.com/products/juliapro) that replaces Juno (you will still need Atom).\n",
    "3. If everything  is working by now, you are ready. If you are working inside Atom, I recommend installing packages directly from the Juno console. You must first type ']' to access \"pkg\" mode. Then, just type ```add Fermionic``` and the package will be downloaded.\n",
    "4. If installation was correct, you can start using all the features of the package  by importing it by typing ```using Fermionic ```"

    "One of the great advantages of defining these operators as types, is that it is possible to simultaneously define operators for different dimensions. This can be useful for a number of applications, for example for comparing results in different dimensions without re-running the core program each time you switch dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object oriented programming, one would define a class Operator. Here, we are defining a type (like Int or Float) and  a method associated to that kind of type. The big advantage of doing this over defining classes, is that Julia uses **multiple dispatch**. What that means, is that a method can be defined for different input types, and Julia will run the correct method depending on all the input's types. Whereas in object oriented programming, programs select the method from the type of the first input only. This will be very useful for defining states, where we can work both with normal arrays and sparse arrays.\n",

This is really handy for defining matrices with many zeros, as no unnecessary memory is used for storing empty elements. The drawback of the sparse representation is that it's hard to understand what is really doing. We can use the function Matrix() in order to convert a sparse matrix into a normal matrix. I recommend doing this only in order to see what is happening, not for doing operations. This is because both memory and time increase enormously  when operations are done with full matrices instead of sparse."
