This can be useful for a number of application, for example for comparing results in different dimensions without re-running the core program each time you switch dimension.\n",

    "In Object oriented programming, one would define a class Operator. Here, we are defining a type (like Int or Float) and method associated to that kind of type. The big advantage of doing this over defining classes, is that Julia uses **multiple dispatch**. What that means, is that a method can be defined for different input types, and Julia will run the correct method depending on all the input's types. Whereas in object oriented programming, programs select the method from the type of the first input only. This will be very useful for defining states, where we can work both with normal arrays and sparse arrays.\n",

    "A sparse matrix is a way of representing a matrix in which one inidicates (row, col) = value. This is really handy for defining matrices with many zeros, as no unnecessary memory is used for storing empty elements. The drawback of the sparse representation is that it's hard to understand what is really doing. We can use the function Matrix() in order to convert a sparse matrix into a normal matrix. I recommend doing this only in order to see what is happening, not for doing operations. This is because both memory and time increase enourmusly when operations are done with full matrices instead of sparse."
